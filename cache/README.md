⚠️ Academic Integrity Notice

This repository is provided **solely for portfolio and recruiter review**.

If you are currently enrolled in **ECE 411 or a similar course**, you should **not read this repository in detail or explore the codebase**. Even passive exposure to this code significantly increases the risk of unintentionally reproducing logic, structure, or design patterns in your own work.

I have worked closely with much of the course staff, and many of them are **very familiar with my coding style, architectural decisions, and implementation details**. As a result, any substantial similarity — even if unintentional — is likely to be detected and will result in an **academic integrity violation**.

In other words: **if you are taking this course, the safest option is to look away and not use this repository at all.**
